<P>Hi @@FirstName,<BR><BR>My name is Doug and I'm the founder and owner of FamilyDetails.com. <BR><BR>You recently signed up to use our service and I wanted to make sure all is going well so far. In the past, a few customers have told us that getting started was challenging.<BR><BR>So I want to find out how your family website is coming along and ask you for a quick favor.<BR><BR>
We are working on improving the getting started process and various part of our&nbsp;website&nbsp;to make it as smooth as possible for everyone in your family to reconnect with one another and would appreciate your thoughts. <BR><BR>Has there been any part of using FamilyDetails.com that you found difficult?
